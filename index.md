**[JOB MARKET PAPER] <br> "Do Firms Avoid Health Insurance Mandates? Evidence from the Self-Funding of Employer Plans"**
> Fifty percent of the U.S. gets health insurance through an employer. For these individuals, their choice of health plan is limited by what the employer chooses to offer. These firm decisions are also the mechanism through which policy can increase (or decrease) welfare. However, little is known about how firms decide what to offer. This paper focuses on an important dimension of the firm's decision: whether to self-fund their health insurance benefits. A self-funded plan is one where firms bear the financial risk of healthcare claims themselves. Unlike fully insured firms, self-funded firms are exempt from all state-level regulations of health insurance. I study whether firms use self-funding to avoid complying with regulations that insurance must cover specific benefits. Using administrative data on the health plans offered by firms in the large-group market and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, I estimate the effect of state mandated benefits on self-funding rates among firms. I find that mandates increase self-funding among smaller firms (100-249 employees) by 3.2 percentage points, an increase of 14.5%. The mandates do not appear to affect larger firms (250+ employees), who are more likely to already be self-funded in the pre-period.

Political and Economic Determinants of State Tax Policy in the Past 70 Years"</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://alisatns.weebly.com" target="_blank">Alisa&nbsp;Tazhitdinova</a> (Under&nbsp;Review)
> We study U.S. state tax rules over the past 70 years to shed light on the determinants of U.S. state tax policy, generating three key results. First, we show that long-term tax trends are not consistent with Tiebout sorting and race-to-the-bottom competition models. Second, we document evidence of increasing polarization of tax rates between Democratic and Republican states in the 1970s and from 2000 onward. Third, we use machine learning techniques to show that the timing and magnitude of tax changes are not driven by federal changes, economic needs, state politics, institutional rules, neighbor competition, or demographics. Altogether, these factors explain less than 20% of observed tax variation.

> To what extent is U.S. state tax policy affected by corporate political contributions? The 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling provides an exogenous shock to corporate campaign spending, allowing corporations to spend on elections in 23 states which previously had spending bans. Ten years after the ruling and for a wide range of outcomes, we are not able to identify economically or statistically significant effects of corporate independent expenditures on state tax policy, including tax rates, discretionary tax breaks, and tax revenues.

<a style="font-weight:bold" href="./research/Robinson_Royer_Silver_CSection.pdf" target="_blank">"Geographic Variation in C-Sections in the United States: Trends, Correlates and Other Interesting Facts"</a> with&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/heathernroyer/" target="_blank">Heather&nbsp;Royer</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/silverdw/" target="_blank">David&nbsp;Silver</a> (Under&nbsp;Review)
> We use U.S. natality data from 1989 to 2017 to investigate county-level geographic disparities in the use of C&#8209;section among ﬁrst-birth singleton mothers. We document the existence and persistence of geographic variation in C&#8209;section across low and high- C&#8209;section risk mothers, the degree to which this variation correlates with Medicare spending, and the sensitivity of C&#8209;section use and infant and maternal health outcomes to C&#8209;section risk across counties. Our key ﬁnding is that counties with high C&#8209;section rates perform more C&#8209;sections across the entirety of the risk distribution yet have nearly equivalent or better outcomes than counties with less intensive C&#8209;section rates.
